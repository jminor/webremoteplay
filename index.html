<h1>Web Remote Play Demo</h1>

<p>Web Remote Play allows you to play local multiplayer games remotely. That is, a game that expects multiple players using a single computer with multiple gamepads, or keyboard controls, can be played remotely over the Internet instead.</p>

<h2>Demos</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Open one of the demos below.</li>
	<li>An auto-generated ID will appear in the URL.</li>
	<li>Copy paste the URL into a second browser window, or send it to your friends.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Note:</em> The game itself runs only in the first player's browser. All other players will see a live-stream video of the game, and their inputs will be sent back to the first player's browser. Depending on the game, you may need to remap the inputs or find which keys correspond to which player.</p>
